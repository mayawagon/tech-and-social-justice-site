The Technology for Social Justice Project (T4SJ) is excited to release a new report, **#MoreThanCode: Practioners Reimagine the landscape of technology for justice and equity.** [Download the Full Report on the new #MoreThanCode site.](https://morethancode.cc/T4SJ_fullreport_082018_AY_web.pdf)

#MoreThanCode is a participatory action research report based on interviews, focus groups, and data analysis with 188 tech practitioners from across the U.S.A. The report explores the current ecosystem and demographics; practitioner experiences; visions and values; documents stories of success and failure; and provides key recommendations for the future of the field. We hope our findings and recommendations will be useful to all those who want to use technology to make a more just and equitable world. 

Key recommendations include:

1. Nothing About Us Without Us: Adopt Co-Design Methods and Concrete Community Accountability Mechanisms;
2. From Silver Bullets to Useful Tools: Change the Narrative, Lead with Values, and Recognize Multiple Frames and Terms Across the Ecosystem;
3. #RealDiversityNumbers: Adopt proven strategies for diversity and inclusion;
4. Developers, Developers, Developers? Recognize Different Roles and Expertise in Tech Work, and Support Alternative Pathways to Participation;
5. Coops, Collectives, and Networks, Oh My! Support Alternative Models Beyond Startups, Government Offices, and Incorporated Nonprofits.

The project is co-led by [Research Action Design](RAD.cat) and the [Open Technology Institute at New America](newamerica.org/oti), together with research partners Upturn, Media Mobilizing Project, Coworker.org, Hack the Hood, May First/People Link, Palante Technology Cooperative, Vulpine Blue, and The Engine Room.
