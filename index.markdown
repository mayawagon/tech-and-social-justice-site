OTI and RAD are conducting a community-led field scan of “technology use in the public interest”  that centers diverse practitioners and identifies challenges and opportunities. This field scan will identify people, groups, institutions, and networks in the space, and explore how best to foster the growth of the field. This is a participatory research project that will be guided by Project Partners (practitioners) and an Advisory Board including allied organizations.
