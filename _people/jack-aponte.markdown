Since 2000, Jack has worked with non-profit organizations, small businesses, artists, and performers to help them to effectively use technology in their work. I have extensive experience with web development; tech support, troubleshooting and maintenance; technology planning and buying; database planning and development; and training on various scales, from workshops to one-on-one tutoring. I work primarily with small, nonprofit community organizations.
