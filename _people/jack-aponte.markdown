Since 2000, I've worked with non-profit organizations, small businesses, artists, and performers to help them to effectively use technology in their work. I have extensive experience with web development; tech support, troubleshooting and maintenance; technology planning and buying; database planning and development; and training on various scales, from workshops to one-on-one tutoring. I work primarily with small, nonprofit community organizations. I'm well accustomed to working within tight budgets and helping to find tech solutions that are affordable, reliable, sustainable and effective. I am also involved in the social justice movement as an activist and volunteer; by bringing my experience as an activist together with my technological expertise, I am able to provide a unique level of support, understanding, and commitment to grassroots organizations.
