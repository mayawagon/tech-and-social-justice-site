I’m Zara - feminist, researcher and writer. I’m a Fellow at Data & Society Research Institute, where I’m looking at the skills and roles needed to successfully implement technology and data projects among human rights defenders and activists. I’m also Research Lead at The Engine Room, where I carry out research to support our work in strengthening the effective use of technology and data in social change and advocacy, and lead our Responsible Data programme looking at the ethical implications of using data in new ways. I write about digital policy and technology in Bangladesh for Global Voices.
