# About this project

This is the site for the Technology for Social Justice Field Scan, a participatory action research project led by [Research Action Design](http://rad.cat) and supported by the [Open Technology Institute](https://opentechinstitute.org) at [The New America Foundation](https://newamerica.org). It was developed by [Maya Wagoner](https://github.com/mayawagon).

## Setup

This website is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and uses the [Jekyll Admin Interface](https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-admin/).

After cloning this repository, start a Jekyll server with:
	
	bundle exec jekyll serve

and navigate your browser to localhost:4000

Yay! You can (hopefully) now see the site in action.

To edit content through the CMS-style admin interface, navigate to http://localhost:4000/admin/. 

## Many thanks to togetherlist!

The "Search Projects & Organizations" page is based on [togetherlist](http://togetherlist.com/), which was created by [Sougwen](http://twitter.com/sougwen), [Raihan](http://twitter.com/raihan_) & [Willow](http://twitter.com/willowbl00) and a bunch of other contributors.

It was modified at the (now defunct) [Public Interest Tech Site](http://github.com/opentechinstitute/public-interest-tech-site/), and you can find more info over there.
