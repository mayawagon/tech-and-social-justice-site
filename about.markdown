The Technology for Social Justice Field Scan is a participatory action research project intended to find out who works in this space, understand the types of work currently being done with technology for social justice (and more broadly, in the public interest), as well as the pathways people take into this work. The goal is to identify people, groups, and networks who work in this space, including those who are not ‘the usual suspects’ in the civic technology world, and to learn from them: what their paths into the work have been; what they see as their greatest constraints; where they see barriers; what they feel is most needed to grow and diversify the field; and what success and failure look like for them.
