When New York City rolled out its plan in February to replace decrepit pay phone booths with 7,500 shiny wireless kiosks connected to fiber-optic cables boasting connection speeds 100 times faster than average public WiFi hotspot, the promise of free, no-strings-attached, super fast public WiFi seemed — to some skeptical New Yorkers — too good to be true.

It was, said Meghan McDermott, an educator and longtime activist who has worked on promoting media literacy, protecting public space and redistributing resources. She directs digital skills and web literacy educational programming for the Mozilla Foundation with the aim of “helping folks not just use the web but make it.” 

That means she coordinates with educators, libraries, museums, schools, nonprofits and entrepreneurs to set up online and in-person, hands-on, multidisciplinary skillshares, meetups, hackathons and after-school programs for middle and high school-aged youth. Students learn open-source software coding and other tech skills by working on collaborative projects, outside of conventional classroom settings, to solve real-world problems. One app, RideW/Me — developed in a Mozilla program by a team of volunteer students, teachers, developers and designers — helps teens in Chicago to find after-school programs as well as peers with whom to travel on public transit. 

“The point is to figure out not only how to help as many people as possible get online but also to reshape infrastructure and public spaces and change the understanding of what is public use,” McDermott said. “The Internet is something that you can own and control, and the culture of it doesn't have to be kept by a handful of white dudes who are designing your experiences online.”

Case in point of a mistaken approach, McDermott said, is New York City’s WiFi kiosks. Because the WiFi stations are free, McDermott said, “the assumption was that it's going to be used widely and it's going to be an important step to bridge the digital divide.” 

But the kiosks’ advertisement-cluttered touchscreens and cellphone charging ports had barely begun to collect graffiti and bird droppings when the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) pointed out that the franchise agreement signed by the city with CityBridge — a consortium of companies behind LinkNYC (the WiFi kiosk program) — lacked “robust language in the privacy policy protecting users against unwarranted government surveillance,” and that CityBridge only promised to make “reasonable efforts” to erase the personal data it stored “12 months after your last login.” 

“They essentially have a privacy policy that says, ‘we can collect anything and do anything’ and that sets the outer bound,” NYCLU attorney, Mariko Hirose, said. 

The kiosks broadcast two wireless networks — one open and public, that does not use encryption and is potential prey for hackers, police and the NSA — and a private network that is encrypted. Currently, only newer Apple devices are able to sign onto the private network that uses encryption. Add that to the fact that most low-income people and African-Americans — who are also the populations that are under the most daily government surveillance — are Android phone users, and it seems likely that it will be the city’s most over-policed people whose personal data will be most vulnerable in the LinkNYC system.

If that’s not enough, McDermott added, some people who live or work near the kiosks have begun to complain about people standing around the hot spots.

The people being complained about “are generally black and brown, and low-income,” she said. 

For McDermott, the WiFi kiosks’ uneven effects on New Yorkers of different income and demographic brackets illustrates exactly why it is important to look beyond the obvious in order to combat the digital divide. People who are profiled by the state in daily life and use the WiFi kiosks as their primary Internet connection were at best, not being equitably served by, and at worst, exposed to potential data theft and police harassment at the city’s free Internet access points. New York’s WiFi kiosks are a glaring example, McDermott said, of the limits of the traditional “inclusion” model — versus the “digital equity” model that she prefers, which seeks to overcome or dismantle structural barriers to participation.

“Digital inclusion is: ‘We want more people to have access to and be present online or have more technology at their disposal,’” Mc Dermott said. “The equity piece is redistribution. It's about folks who don't have traditional access or means, who have the most to lose and gain from using technology. If it's not in their hands, it'll be used by others to gain from them.” 

Who owns what — and what is public — have been key questions guiding McDermott’s work for years. 

“We've really lost public space and public goods over many decades,” she said. Funders who “throw money at innovation and see what sticks” exacerbate the current problems, McDermott said. 

“I would love to see a shift away from, ‘Fail fast! Go big! Make some crazy stuff!’” she added. “That actually does damage to fragile economies. Uber, TaskRabbit, and the on-demand economy is a result of money being thrown at innovation in a venture capitalist frame. Funders need to shift away from innovation for the sake of what's profitable to things that are truly invested in the service of public space. That means that funders have to understand what the value of the public space is and shift away from innovation to inclusion.”

McDermott’s role at Mozilla is to facilitate a similar digital redistribution by helping train those historically left out of the field to build and protect a “free, open web” and “digitally equitable” Internet that is a public resource. But working to change “historic, ongoing inequality” can be slow, she said. “Even if people come up with different kinds of programs to diversify who has access to the knowledge, it feels like a Band-aid.”

“But that doesn't mean you stop,” she added.

To that end, she’s working with educators and colleges to formally institute “alternative credentialing” systems that include portfolios that showcase how a young person’s work changed over a period of time, and “digital badges” that youth earn when they finish a computer science camp or an online tech training, for instance. The point isn’t to promote tech learning for its own sake, McDermott said, but to make more paths available to young people and change up the Internet. 

“To me, learning encryption doesn't mean anything to a young person who's trying to pull together enough train fare to get to an after school program,” she said. “Part of the work of the education portfolio is to figure out how these can become part of an arsenal for that young person to use to get what they need.” 

Ultimately, the hope is that younger, socially conscious and digitally-empowered generations — including the students who designed the app, RideW/Me — will “actually remake the functionality of the Internet by redesigning it to meet their own needs,” McDermott said. “That’s where we're going to start to see the slow shift in who has access and where people gain power and start to make changes.”
